# Hue2Widget

This folder contains a stub WidgetKit extension. After running `expo prebuild -p ios`, open the Xcode workspace and add a new Widget Extension target named "Hue2Widget" pointing to this folder. Ensure it's embedded in the app and included in the build phases.

Later we can automate PBX target wiring.
